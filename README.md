# Disease Prediction Using ML and NLP

Correlation between Disease and Symptoms using Text Analytics

## Abstract

The correlation between infections and symptoms has long posed a significant challenge to medical professionals. This project aims to utilize Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect and predict correlations between symptoms and diseases.


## Introduction

The correlation between diseases and symptoms is a critical issue in healthcare that has been studied extensively. This project aims to explore the use of NLP and ML techniques to improve the detection and prediction of diseases based on symptoms.

## Literature Review

In recent years, the use of ML and NLP techniques in the healthcare industry has gained popularity. This literature review provides an overview of recent research works focusing on the application of ML, NLP, and quantum computing in healthcare for disease diagnosis, symptom detection, medical information extraction, and disease classification.

## Methodology

The project utilizes a dataset and performs data preprocessing, data visualization, and model evaluation. The dataset is analyzed using Pandas for data cleansing and validation. Visual analysis is conducted using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Wordcloud libraries to gain insights into category distribution and data preparation. Various ML models such as Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and a Deep Learning model are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## Results

The evaluated models demonstrate varying levels of performance. The Logistic Regression model using TF-IDF feature extraction achieves the highest accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score among the models. The Deep Learning model performs relatively lower compared to the other models.

## Conclusion

Based on the evaluation metrics, the Logistic Regression model appears to be the most effective in classifying diseases based on symptoms. However, the selection of a model depends on various factors such as the problem nature, data availability, and computational complexity.

## Future Work

Future work could involve exploring additional ML algorithms, optimizing hyperparameters, and incorporating more extensive datasets to improve the performance of the models. Further research could focus on enhancing the Deep Learning model's performance by considering factors such as data augmentation and transfer learning.
